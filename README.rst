Overview
--------

A Simple application, that allows you to train a small neural network based on handpoints obtained from mediapipe.
This is part of an underdevelopment project to create a windows application that enables users 
to control their mouse inputs using handgestures. I am very excited to see how the final work would turn out ðŸ˜€!


Head Start
-----------

This repo can be cloned using ``git clone https://github.com/johanjino/Hand-Gesture-Detector``, a simple git command (make sure git is installed ðŸ™‚).
Then simply run the ``main.py`` function. Please note a few python libraries may need to be installed on your machine if not already found.


Background
----------

| The question "Why not?" is one of my motives for everything. A huge plus is this was my first intro to ML, hence helping me learn as I progress.
| Moreover, being able to do something differently is interesting and who can imagine what I would stumble upon while building this!
|
Mainly, this could be a huge tech leap where one day professors at university could use similar technology while teaching to students while at the same
time live streaming it. Being a student, this was one idea I thought of. Please feel free to Discuss more on this on Discussions or you can send me an email
with what you think ðŸ™‚. Anything would be greatly appreciated.
